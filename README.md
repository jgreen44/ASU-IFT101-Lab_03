**Lab 3 â€“ More Programming with Python**

**Problem 1: (20 points)**

Write a Python program to read in three numbers from the user, calculate their average and print it.
You do NOT have to use a loop in your solution.

Read in each of the three numbers using an instruction like this:
number\_1 = int( input() )

Use the print() function to print the average value.

This video discusses a **similar** problem and it might help you with writing your python code:

**Problem 2: (20 points)**

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Then, depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2? You may also want to Google about the modulus operator and how to use it in Python.

You will need to print a message that asks the user to enter a number. Use an instruction similar to this:
print(&quot;Please enter an integer value:&quot;)

Then you will need to read in an integer value using the int( input() ) functions as described in Problem 1.

Then you will use the modulus operator (%) to determine whether the number is even or odd. You will need to use a decision logic structure for that. See the lesson slides (4\_ch4\_ch5.pptx) to see how a decision logic structure (if/else statement) is implemented in Python. You may also just Google it.
